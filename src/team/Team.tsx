            <p className="mt-4 text-gray-500">
              Katie's career in tech started in 2012 when she learned about
              bitcoin and began trading. She was inspired to pursue computer
              science to gain a deeper understanding of the technology. Through
              a series of lucky breaks and good fortune, she secured her first
              full time agency engineering position at SpireMedia in 2014. She
              spent 5 years of her career at agencies, where she was able to
              gain familiarity with the full software development lifecycle and
              see countless products through from concept to market. She's been
              responsible for the development of native mobile applications,
              complex front ends, scalable back ends, and even some devops. Most
              of the code she's written isn't open source because she enjoys
              being paid, but here are a few repositories that she's authored
              which are exposed to the public.
